## About

This is meant to a "journal"of my progress with my 3D Printer, if you learn or use something, great  :smile:

### Progress

As I make progress, which will be slow and steady, it will be linked [here](https://github.com/fskelly/CrealityEnder3Pro/blob/master/progress/README.md)

### Firmware

As I build and test firmware, it will be published as well. I am now simple keeping the "base" files and then compiling the firmware based upon the key files.  

1. Bootscreen.h
2. Statusscreen.h
3. Configuration.h
4. Configuration_adv.h
