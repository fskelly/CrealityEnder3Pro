# October 2020 Progress

## 07-October-2020  

Filament Runout Sensor (Microswicth version) is now and running and working, agin, more JST XH crimps.

## 06-October-2020  

BLTouch is finally wired in and working, lots of JST XH crimps alter, but worth the effort, printing really nicely now.

## 04-October-2020

Some rewiring is needed, my first attempt did not work out so well. Happily the Ender 3 is [open-sourced](https://github.com/Creality3DPrinting/Ender-3) so I can find the required wiring and try again.  

**Personal Rant :** Really wish that everyone used the same connectors. Silly Ender 3 uses JST PH on the motor connections and JST XH everywhere else. I only bought replacement JST XH. Thank goodness I own a soldering iron. :smile:
